# Kachigga

A tiny shell system developed in Python, for Windows and Linux.

## Description

The point of this project is less to make a fully functional, multi-purpose, beast of a shell, but rather
to learn about how shell processes function and expand my knowledge of Python along the way.

## Commands

    $aw         Greets user with the name of the user account
    $echo       Outputs the arguments string
    $cwd        Returns current working directory
    $ls/dir     Return current files and folders in current working directory
    $cd         Changes current working directory
    $nicetext   Uses pyfiglet to return ASCII art version of arguments string
    $scrabble   Gives the amount of points the arguments string is worth in Scrabble
    $exit       Exits Kachigga
